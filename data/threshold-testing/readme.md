The files in this sub-directory are of a similar format to those in the previous directory. Various iterations of the algorithm were tested: different reflectivity thresholds were tested for 2 Aug 2019 Doppler Radar data. The results of the same are within this directory. 

The following reflectivity thresholds were tested: 
- Ref >= 5 dBZ
- Ref >= 10 dBZ
- Ref >= 15 dBZ
- Ref >= 20 dBZ
- 10 dBZ <= Ref <= 25 dBZ
- 10 dBZ <= Ref <= 40 dBZ
- 10 dBZ <= Ref <= 55 dBZ
